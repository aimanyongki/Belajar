## Terminology
**Shell scripting**: commands written for the shell to execute<br>
**Shell script**: A file or program that shell will execute<br>
**Sh (Bourne Shell)**: A shell interpreter<br>
**Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**: The improved version of Sh<br>

## How it works
Let's take an example.<br>
One common command people used is touch for creating a file. touch is a binary executable file located inside /bin directory of the system.<br>

After executing the touch command, the shell interpreter will checks for an alias present in .bash_profile in home directory. If alias is not present, then it looks for a binary executable file in the PATH.<br>

We are allowed to execute multiple Bash commands saved in a file and execute them at once with bash function.
